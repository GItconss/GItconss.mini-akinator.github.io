### Project Description
[visit my page](https://gitconss.github.io/GItconss.mini-akinator.github.io/)

Gussing top 100 football players name with right amount of questions.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In the age of instant information, football fans enjoy testing their knowledge and challenging their friends, but there is no widely available, interactive platform that can accurately guess the football player someone is thinking of through a short series¬†of¬†questions.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

The Football Player Guesser addresses this gap by providing an interactive, web-based guessing game that uses a structured database of football players and their attributes‚Äîsuch as nationality, position, and club‚Äîto identify the player the user¬†is¬†thinking¬†of.

## Technical Details
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the game interface, question display, and dynamic updates without refreshing the page.

    Backend: Django (Python) for handling game logic, question sequencing, and database interactions.
